   <p>Why did we build Runhouse? To enable fast, debuggable, and iterable development of machine learning workflows.</p>

   <strong>Without Runhouse, the ML workflow is fragmented and slow</strong>

   <ul>
     <li>Researchers start in hosted notebooks or SSH'ed into a cluster:
       <ul>
         <li>Fast and interactive development</li>
         <li>But typically compute, environment, and code all look very different from production</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Research to production happens over the course of days or weeks:
       <ul>
         <li>Notebook code needs translation to orchestrator nodes</li>
         <li>Iteration loops take about 20+ minutes, as engineers wait for pipelines to rebuild and rerun</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Production debugging is challenging:
       <ul>
         <li>Orchestrators designed for scheduling and logging runs, but are not development-friendly runtimes</li>
         <li>Continue the slow "debug through deployment" process which plagued research to production as well</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
   </ul>

   <strong>With Runhouse, serverless execution of regular code on your own cloud compute enables easy development and deployment</strong>
   <ul>
     <li>Researchers write normal code:
       <ul>
         <li>Each dispatch takes &lt;5 seconds, providing interactive development experience</li>
         <li>Code executes on the same compute and environment as production</li>
         <li>Logs stream back to local</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Moving to production is instant:
       <ul>
         <li>Orchestrator nodes contain 5 lines of dispatch code (not 200 lines of application code)</li>
         <li>Rather than being your ML runtime, orchestrators are simply used to schedule, log, and monitor runs</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Easily debug or update pipelines in production:
       <ul>
         <li>Branch the underlying code</li>
         <li>Make changes and dispatch iteratively, like in the research step</li>
         <li>Merge back into main when the pipeline runs locally</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
   </ul>

   <p>In short, Runhouse makes ML development feel like normal software development.</p>
