PyTorch lets you send a model or tensor :code:`.to(device)`, so why can't you do :code:`my_fn.to('a_gcp_a100')`,
or :code:`my_table.to('parquet_in_s3')`?
Runhouse allows just that: send code and data to any of your compute or data infra (with your own cloud creds),
all in Python, and continue to use them eagerly exactly as they were.

Runhouse has four top-level objectives:


* Allowing users to natively program across compute resources
* Allowing users to command data between storage and compute
* Making resources accessible across environments and users
* Allowing resources to be shared among teams as living assets

Keep reading on to see how Runhouse achieves this, or explore our
:ref:`Architecture Section <High-level Architecture>`, :ref:`Python API`, and `Tutorials <https://github.com/run-house/tutorials>`_.

.. warning::
    **This is an Alpha:**
    Runhouse is heavily under development and we expect to iterate on the APIs before reaching beta (version 0.1.0).


Getting Started üê£
------------------
.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install runhouse
    # Or "runhouse[aws]", "runhouse[gcp]", "runhouse[azure]", "runhouse[all]"

Please check out the :ref:`Installation` section for more detailed instructions.
