PyTorch lets you send a model or tensor :code:`.to(device)`, so why can't you do :code:`my_fn.to('a_gcp_a100')`,
or :code:`my_table.to('parquet_in_s3')`?
Runhouse allows just that: send code and data to any of your compute or data infra (with your own cloud creds),
all in Python, and continue to use them eagerly exactly as they were.

Runhouse lets you:

* Natively program across compute resources
* Seamlessly command data between storage and compute
* Access resources across environments and users
* Shared resources among teams as living assets
